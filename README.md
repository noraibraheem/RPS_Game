Rock-paper-scissors is a game played between two people, where each player simultaneously chooses one option from three available choices: rock, paper, or scissors. The objective is to select the option that beats the opponent:

    Rock beats scissors
    Scissors beat paper
    Paper beats rock

The game is played in a series of rounds, with the winner of each round earning a point. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined number of points, typically three or five.

Rock-paper-scissors is a popular game used to make decisions or settle disputes in a fair and impartial manner. It's simple to learn, but there is also some strategy involved. In this repository, you'll find a simple implementation of the game in Python. 

Additionally, I have created a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game, which you can see in the included screenshot below. Have fun playing!
